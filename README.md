# FannieMae_Mortgage_Prediction
Real estate plays a fundamental role in the U.S. economy. Housings combined contribution to
the U.S. GDP generally averages between 15-18%. Real estate is commonly purchased using
mortgages, which are debt instruments secured by the collateral of real estate property, that
the borrower is obliged to pay back with a predetermined set of payments. If the borrower
stops paying the mortgage, the lender can foreclose, which is a legal process where a lender
will recover the property which secured the loan by evicting the tenants and selling the
property to recover the balance of the mortgage.

A foreclosure is devastating to the individual(s) borrower affecting their ability to get approval
for another mortgage. Not only that but the impact of foreclosure is felt sharply by the provider
of the mortgage. According to the Financial Times, three of America's biggest banks have set
aside a combined $28 bn for current and future loan losses. This causes a negative impact on
banks' earnings as they must set aside loan provisions as mandated by The Federal Reserve to
mitigate the risk of a bank failing from too many loan losses. Also, investors of said banks are
hurt as well since regulators also cap the dividends allowed given the new regulations put in
place since the financial crisis of 2007-2008 to mitigate the risk that banks will not have the
cash on hand to continue to provide their essential function in the economy. So, can banks
mitigate the risk they endure by providing mortgages that could go into foreclosure? This paper
will analyze publicly available information to understand the variables that influence loan
delinquency for loans 2 years after loan origination. We will also build models to predict if
someone will default in the first 2 years of the mortgage lifespan as well as the time the
mortgage defaults. In our application we focused on Fannie Mae loan data from 2013Q1 to
2018Q4 to train our models. The machine learning classifiers adopted help to discriminate
between default and active loans while the survival analysis methods provide time dependent
analysis of probabilities.
